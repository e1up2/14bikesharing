# bikesharing
## Overview
The objective of the bikesharing analysis is to determine whether a bikesharing venture will be successful. We would create tableau visualization from  New York bikesharing data to amswer questions such as:
- how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August?
- what is the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers?
- what is the demographics of bike riders in New York?
- what are the top starting locations and the top ending locations?
- what are the peak hours?
- what are the typical checkout times?
- what is the typical bike utilization?
Answers to these types of questions will help determine if a similar bike sharing business will be sucessful in Des moines IOWA.

## Purpose
The complete purpose of this project was to make creative visualizations so that the data in a csv file was digestible to people who've never written a line of code, like our investors. The visualizations i created are as follows:

  1. Checkout Times for Users
  2. Checkout Times by Gender
  3. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
  4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
  5. Users Trips by Gender by Weekday

# Results
Through creating the vizulizations listed above I was able to draw clear trends and conclusions

- Checkout Times for Users: I was able to conclude that an overwhelming amount of trips last less than 20 minutes

- Checkout Times by Gender: Here we can see that men checkout bikes almost 3 times as much as woman but more or less have the same trip duration

- Trips by Weekday for Each Hour: I concluded that the most popular hours for people to pick up a Citi Bike is during commute hours (6-8am and 5-7pm) which makes perfect sense.

- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): Here we have a similar conclusion to the last vizualization. Bikes are driven primarily during usual commute hours and just like the "Checkout Times by Gender" viz shows, user type for Citi Bikes is primarily male.

- Users Trips by Gender by Weekday: We can see thst males are the dominant user type and the most popular days to ride are Thursday and Friday

## Summary
The analysis of the New York bike sharing data provided the follwoing insights:
- the month of August is a good month for biking recording 2,344,224 trips
- 81.07% of bike riders are annual customers and 18.93% are short-term customers.
- the ratio of male bike riders to female bike riders is 3:1
- Thursdays between 5pm and 8pm is the peak period for the month of August

##### Additional Analysis
1. To provide further insight, we may perform the same set of analyses for multiple months of the year. This type of analysis can help determine any pattern or trend to the demand for bike-sharing services for the year
2. Another visualization we may perform is determining how many start stations are also end stations for the same trip. Knowing that a bike trip started and ended in the same location can help illuminate questions around the number of stations required for a specified geographic area.
